# Resume_Statement_Generator
Python resume statement generator that I built using a self-created csv of soft skills. Can be used for almost any position.

I created this python resume statement generator for fun and for my own use. It takes a csv I made of various soft skills that employers look for and randomly generates an appealing statement. Not all the statements come out sounding perfect, but many are convincing. 

Try it! Use it! Have fun. All you have to do is run the code. It will ask you for the position name, if you have any experience in the field, and how many years. That's it! 


Sample statements from my generator:

"Enthusiatic, independent team player who likes to respect differences and construct visuals. I'm an aspiring data analyst who values management and confidence."

"Solutions-Focused, decisive person of integrity who likes to listen and build a narrative. I'm an aspiring data analyst who values self-direction and persuasion."

"Solutions-Focused, patient delegator who likes to work hard and make decisions. I'm an experienced data scientist with 8 years in the field who values energy and humor."

"Competitive, open-minded person of integrity who likes to give clear feedback and read body language. I'm an experienced communications manager with 4 years in the field who values good attitude and following direction."

"Patient, compelling life-long learner who likes to manage conflict and delegate. I'm an aspiring teacher who values giving clear feedback and conflict management."

"Enterprising, solutions-focused designer who likes to seek knowledge and manage people and projects. I'm an experienced astronaut with 10 years in the field who values innovation and leadership."
